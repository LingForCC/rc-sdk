# rc-sdk
Extensible sdk wrapper framework around ringcentral-js sdk and ringcentral-web-phone.

The goal of this project is to create an extensible wrapper around the current ringcentral-js and ringcentral-web-phone.
The result should be an UI agnostic rc phone unit that can easily be custominzed. It should therefore be easy to fit any UI to the phone system, be it jQuery based UI implementation, Angular, or React.
